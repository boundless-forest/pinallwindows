Tests are run with Node's built-in test runner:

- `pnpm test`

The tests cover:

- pure shared logic in `src/shared/` (URL parsing + sync planning);
- window eligibility, compact-window safety, and picture-in-picture ambiguity;
- mutation and pending-user-intent tracking;
- controller-level synchronization with a fake Chrome API.
- window merging: ordering, groups, pinned duplicates, current-page selection,
  partial failures, changing tabs, window eligibility, and sync serialization.

Real Chrome window metadata and UI behavior are still validated manually by loading the extension in `chrome://extensions`.

Window-merge checks in Chrome:

1. Open two normal windows, open the panel in the destination, and click **Merge here** on the other window's heading. Verify source tab order, destination selection, and automatic source-window closure.
2. Include named/colored/collapsed groups, shared pinned sites, unique pins, and identical regular URLs. Check that groups and unique pins survive, only shared pinned copies disappear, and regular duplicates stay open.
3. Hide pinned tabs and merge a window containing only pinned tabs. Verify that its heading still offers the merge action.
4. Switch focus between windows with the panel open. **Current window** must still refer to the panel's host. Check the layout at 320px width and keyboard activation of the merge button.
5. During a merge, double-click the action or try another action in the panel. Check that a second operation is prevented. If a tab/window changes or Chrome refuses a move, remaining tabs must stay open and an error must be shown.
6. Verify that popup/floating windows are excluded and merge is unavailable for ambiguous compact windows or across normal/incognito browsing modes. Successful merges show no notice or undo action.

Verified with Chrome for Testing 153.0.8010.12 in an isolated profile on 2026-09-05: actual tab IDs and ordering, current-page selection, shared and special pins, group names/colors/collapse state (including a group-only window), hidden-pins-only windows, keyboard activation, duplicate-click prevention, and the layout at 320px. Chrome unpins tabs during cross-window moves and may expand an active group; the merge restores both states explicitly.
